## The Problem

In most households, one person becomes the unofficial family secretary — tracking appointments, remembering groceries, managing chores, planning meals, and keeping everyone's schedule straight. It's invisible labor that burns people out.

Rowan gives families a **shared brain** so no one has to carry it all alone.

## What Rowan Does

### Organize — Keep everything on track

- **Tasks & Chores** — Assign to any family member with due dates, priorities, and recurring schedules. Rotating chore assignments keep the workload fair.
- **Family Calendar** — Shared calendar syncs everyone's schedule in real time. Event proposals let you suggest plans without overcommitting.
- **Smart Reminders** — Notify the right person at the right time. Snooze, complete, or reschedule with a tap.

### Coordinate — Stay connected, stay aligned

- **Family Messages** — Private messaging keeps conversations organized and off social media. Pin important info so it never gets buried.
- **Shopping Lists** — Collaborative lists update in real time as anyone adds or checks off items. Share lists externally with a link.
- **Meal Planning** — Plan weekly meals, save recipes, and track ingredients. Import recipes from any URL with AI.

### Grow — Build toward what matters

- **Budget & Expenses** — Track household spending with category breakdowns, recurring bill detection, and partner balance splitting.
- **Family Goals** — Set goals with milestones, check-ins, and progress tracking. Celebrate wins together.
- **Rewards System** — Motivate the household with points, badges, and redeemable rewards.

### Plus

- **Home Projects** — Track renovations and projects with milestones, line items, vendors, and budgets.
- **Location Sharing** — See where family members are (when they choose to share).
- **Year in Review** — Reflect on what your family accomplished together.

## Rowan AI

Rowan includes a built-in AI assistant that can manage your household through natural conversation. Ask it to:

- Create tasks, events, reminders, and chores
- Plan meals and find recipes
- Add items to your shopping list
- Track expenses and check your budget
- Set goals and update progress
- Send messages to your family
- Manage home projects and vendors
- Award points and manage rewards
- Run batch operations across multiple features

The AI has access to 100+ tools spanning every feature in the app — it's like having a personal household manager on call.
