# Space Management Guide

## Overview

Rowan's Space Management feature allows you to organize your life across multiple households, teams, or groups. Each space is an isolated environment with its own tasks, calendar events, messages, and other features.

## What is a Space?

A **Space** is a collaborative workspace where you and your invited members can:
- Share tasks and to-do lists
- Coordinate calendar events
- Set up reminders
- Exchange messages
- Manage shopping lists
- Plan meals together
- Track household projects
- Set and achieve goals together

Think of a space as your shared digital home base. You might have one space for your household, another for a volunteer group, and yet another for a side project with friends.

## Key Concepts

### Space Roles

When you create a space, you become the **Owner**. You can invite other members who will have **Member** status. Currently, all members have equal access to create, edit, and delete items within the space.

### Multiple Spaces

You can belong to multiple spaces and easily switch between them. Each space maintains its own separate data - what you do in one space doesn't affect another.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Space

When you first sign up for Rowan, a space is automatically created for you during the registration process. However, you can create additional spaces at any time.

**To create a new space:**

1. **From the Dashboard:**
   - If you don't have a space yet, click the **"Create Your Space"** button in the header
   - If you already have a space, use the Space Selector dropdown (next to the date) and click **"Create New Space"**

2. **From Settings:**
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Spaces** tab
   - Scroll to the **"Create New Space"** section
   - Click **"New Space"** button

3. **Fill in the Details:**
   - Enter a descriptive name for your space (e.g., "Smith Family", "Book Club", "Project Team")
   - Click **"Create Space"**

Your new space will be created instantly and you'll be switched to it automatically.

## Best Practices

### Naming Your Spaces

Choose clear, descriptive names that make it easy to identify the space's purpose:

**Good Examples:**
- "Johnson Family Home"
- "Marketing Team Projects"
- "Book Club 2024"
- "Vacation Planning"

**Avoid:**
- Generic names like "Space 1", "My Space"
- Unclear abbreviations
- Names that don't indicate the group or purpose

### Inviting Members

- **Verify email addresses** before sending invitations to avoid typos
- **Communicate outside Rowan** to let people know an invitation is coming
- **Resend invitations** if they expire before someone accepts
- **Start with a small group** and add more members as needed

### Organizing Multiple Spaces

- **Keep spaces focused** on specific groups or purposes
- **Switch intentionally** to avoid mixing up tasks between spaces
- **Use consistent naming** if you have related spaces (e.g., "Work Team A", "Work Team B")
- **Archive or leave** spaces you're no longer using (feature coming soon)

---

## Privacy & Security

### Data Isolation

- **Each space is completely separate** - members of one space cannot see data from your other spaces
- **Invitations are secure** - unique tokens ensure only the intended recipient can join
- **Email verification required** - only verified email addresses can receive and accept invitations

### What Members Can See

When you invite someone to a space, they will be able to see:
- All tasks, events, reminders, and messages in that space
- Other members of the space
- Space activity and history

They will NOT be able to see:
- Your other spaces
- Data from your personal account
- Spaces you belong to that they don't

## Troubleshooting

### I didn't receive an invitation email

**Check these common issues:**
1. **Spam/Junk folder** - Rowan emails might be filtered
2. **Email address** - Verify the sender used the correct email
3. **Email delivery delays** - Wait a few minutes and refresh
4. **Ask the sender to resend** - They can send a new invitation

### The invitation link says "expired"

Invitation links are valid for 7 days. After that, they expire for security reasons. Ask the person who invited you to send a new invitation.

### I can't switch spaces

**Try these solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes the UI needs to update
2. **Clear cache** - Browser cache might be stale
3. **Check your internet connection** - Switching requires an active connection
4. **Log out and back in** - This refreshes your session

### I accidentally switched to the wrong space

No problem! Just use the Space Selector to switch back. Your work in each space is saved separately.
