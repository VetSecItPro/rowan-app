## 🎨 Visual Design Implementation Guide

### Glassmorphism Styling

**CSS Template:**
```css
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.glass-card:hover {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
  border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
  box-shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}

.glass-card-dark {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

**Tailwind Classes:**
```jsx
className="bg-white/10 dark:bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-lg border border-white/20 dark:border-white/10 rounded-xl shadow-xl hover:shadow-2xl hover:bg-white/15 transition-all"
```

### Color Palette for Goals

**Status Colors:**
- Not Started: `text-gray-400 bg-gray-100`
- Active: `text-blue-600 bg-blue-50`
- In Progress: `text-blue-600 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600`
- Completed: `text-green-600 bg-green-50`
- On Hold: `text-yellow-600 bg-yellow-50`
- Abandoned: `text-red-400 bg-red-50`

**Priority Colors:**
- P1 (Urgent): `text-red-600 bg-red-50 border-red-300`
- P2 (High): `text-orange-600 bg-orange-50 border-orange-300`
- P3 (Medium): `text-blue-600 bg-blue-50 border-blue-300`
- P4 (Low): `text-gray-600 bg-gray-50 border-gray-300`

**Progress Colors:**
- 0-25%: Light blue (`from-blue-200 to-blue-300`)
- 26-50%: Medium blue (`from-blue-400 to-blue-500`)
- 51-75%: Blue to green (`from-blue-500 to-green-400`)
- 76-99%: Green (`from-green-400 to-green-500`)
- 100%: Vibrant green (`from-green-500 to-green-600`)

### Animation Examples

**Progress Bar Animation:**
```css
@keyframes fillProgress {
  from { width: 0%; }
  to { width: var(--progress); }
}

.progress-bar {
  animation: fillProgress 1s ease-out forwards;
}
```

**Confetti on Completion:**
```typescript
import confetti from 'canvas-confetti';

const celebrate = () => {
  confetti({
    particleCount: 100,
    spread: 70,
    origin: { y: 0.6 }
  });
};
```

## Technical Considerations

### Database Migrations Needed
1. `goal_collaborators` table for shared goals
2. `goal_dependencies` table for relationships
3. `milestone_dependencies` table for milestone dependencies
4. Add columns: `visibility`, `owner_id`, `parent_goal_id`, `is_recurring`, `recurrence_pattern`, `priority_order`, `pinned`
5. `goal_check_ins` table for check-in history
6. `goal_templates` table for reusable templates
7. `achievement_badges` table for gamification

### External Dependencies
- **Chart.js** or **Recharts** for data visualization
- **react-beautiful-dnd** or **@dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop
- **canvas-confetti** for celebration animations
- **date-fns** (already installed) for date calculations
- **framer-motion** for smooth animations
- **OpenAI API** (optional) for AI insights

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy load analytics dashboard (code splitting)
- Memoize expensive calculations (useMemo, useCallback)
- Virtualize long lists (react-window)
- Debounce search inputs
- Optimize real-time subscriptions (only subscribe to active goals)
- Image optimization for progress charts

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Skip links for navigation
- Alt text for all images/icons
